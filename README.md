# House Market Place App üèò

## What it is
This is a fullstack application I developed that allows users to view offers of houses for rent or for sale. To rent, sell a house users can sign in with their own account or use Google OAuth. House listings have lot's of details that are speicific to the house and can viewed on a map. 

## Technologies used
This application was built using using JavaScript, ReactJS, and Firebase as a database and authentication. Firebase made this process simpler as acted as an all in one technology. The site can be viewed [here.](https://house-market-place.vercel.app) Enjoy!
